This has nothing to do with the project.
Just wanted to say thanks for an excellent 
year and challenging class. 
Going into Comp150 last semester, I was sure it
would be awful and boring and oh my gosh, what
idiot would willingly sit in front of a 
computer and write programs. Who enjoys that?

But you showed me how cool and awsome it is,
and I would not be here if you weren't teaching.

Thank you!
